My project is an entirely text-based replica of the card game UNO. 
The program starts with players getting hands randomly dealt to them and assigned to an arraylist. 
The program switches between the playerâ€™s turns with them either playing a card, or being forced to draw a card if none 
of their cards in hand match the one in play. There are two players that can take a turn. When prompted, either draw a card, 
or choose a card from your hand to play. The game will end and one player will win when either hand (arraylist) runs out of cards.
